"""Salesforce connector client.

Read-only adapter: surfaces renewal-date and ARR-change signals for an account.
OAuth-based; Phase 1 scope is read adapters only.

KNOWN ISSUE (AC-114): the OAuth access token refresh fails after ~60 minutes
in staging — long-running sessions lose their token and can't transparently
refresh. Workaround (in fix/salesforce-oauth-refresh): a shorter-lived token
with *proactive* refresh ahead of expiry. Until that lands this connector is
YELLOW and not deployed to staging.
